# The Gut Microbiome, Mediterranean Diet and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk: Analysis Programs

This repository contains the analysis programs for a project that tests whether the gut microbiome modifies the protective effects of a healthy Mediterranean-style dietary patter on cardiometabolic disease risk in 307 male participants from [the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study](https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/hpfs/). We used both R and SAS 9.4 for this analysis.
